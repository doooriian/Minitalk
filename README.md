## ‚ú® Overview

**Minitalk** is an individual project at 42 School that challenges students to implement a simple yet robust communication system between processes using UNIX signals. In this project, a server process waits for incoming messages sent by a client process using `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` signals. The goal is to reliably transmit complete messages from the client to the server, handling data conversion and synchronization without using standard inter-process communication methods.

For the bonus part, I extended the project capabilities to handle more complex scenarios such as:
- **Enhanced communication protocol**: Allowing for larger and multibyte messages.
- **Reliable transmission**: Implementations to confirm message receipt and handle potential data loss.
- **Improved synchronization**: Managing the signal flow efficiently even with overlapping transmissions.

## üìë Key Features

- **Signal-Based Communication**: Uses UNIX signals (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`) to transmit data bit by bit.
- **Server-Client Architecture**: 
  - **Server**: Continuously listens for incoming signals and reconstructs messages.
  - **Client**: Converts the message into binary format and sends it to the server.
- **Bonus Implementations**:
  - Support for extended messaging, ensuring that the entire message is reliably transmitted.
  - Implemented acknowledgement signals for improved synchronization between client and server.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to manage unexpected signals and invalid inputs.
